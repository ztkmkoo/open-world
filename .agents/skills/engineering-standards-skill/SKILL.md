# Engineering Standards Skill

Apply these global standards on every coding, design, and documentation task.

## Absolute Rules

1. Never guess unclear requirements during planning.
2. Ask the user 1-3 clarifying questions when any requirement is ambiguous.
3. Do not start implementation until those questions are answered.
4. Write all repository deliverables in English only: code, docs, comments, commit messages, and PR draft text.
5. User conversation language can be Korean, but repository artifacts must remain English.
6. Work at a senior engineering level: optimize for time/memory/IO, maintainable architecture, and clear boundaries.
7. Follow minimal-change principle while preserving quality: tests, error handling, and edge cases.
8. Avoid over-engineering; choose the simplest design that satisfies the current stage.

## Compliance Notes

- Other skills must comply with this skill instead of duplicating these standards.
- If any skill instruction conflicts with this standard, this standard takes precedence unless the user explicitly overrides it.
